## __About me__

I was born in Russia and living here whole my life. Now im thinking about migration. 
There aren't so many ways to migrate so i decide to learn coding and get a job as Frontend developer. 

My zodiac sign is __Aries__ so its says a lot about me. My personal qualities is a hard work, leadership, determination.
How can i briefly describe myself? Pretty stubborn. In good ways of course. 

As worker im independble, team player, cold headed. I can easily understand business logic of our project so it will help to push and motivate others to get good results.
